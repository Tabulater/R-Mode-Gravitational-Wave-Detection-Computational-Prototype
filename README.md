# R-Mode-Gravitational-Wave-Detection-Computational-Prototype
This prototype demonstrates how the analytical r-mode gravitational-wave frequency model from “The role of r-modes in pulsar spin-down, pulsar timing, and gravitational waves” can be embedded directly into a computational signal-tracking pipeline.
